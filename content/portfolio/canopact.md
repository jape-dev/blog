description: Internal Communications app for Slack
---

Prior to the rise of collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, internal communications tooling was mostly focused around email and intranet sites.

With the onset of remote and hybrid working, accellerated by global lockdowns, more and more companies adopted collaboration tools as their primary internal communications channel.

Canopact is an internal communications app for Slack, which provides some of the email/intranet functionality that isn't available natively on the platform (e.g. newlsetters, engagement analytics, alias posting etc.) 

Canopact was acquired in 2025.
