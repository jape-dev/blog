      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;whats-the-problem-with-current-data-tooling&#34;&gt;What&amp;rsquo;s the problem with current data tooling?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently &amp;lsquo;ETL&amp;rsquo; (extract, transform, load) is a job that is done by Data Engineers between a source and a target system. Usually the target system is is a data warehouse such as Snowflake, BigQuery, or Redshift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But non technical users also perform &amp;lsquo;ETL&amp;rsquo; tasks all the time. Marketing teams import data into their product management tool to build reports. Sales teams import data into their CRM to enrich their pipeline. Operations teams import order data into work management tools to manage their supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prior to the rise of collaboration tools like Slack and Microsoft Teams, internal communications tooling was mostly focused around email and intranet sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the onset of remote and hybrid working, accellerated by global lockdowns, more and more companies adopted collaboration tools as their primary internal communications channel.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canopact is an internal communications app for Slack, which provides some of the email/intranet functionality that isn&amp;rsquo;t available natively on the platform (e.g. newlsetters, engagement analytics, alias posting etc.)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to start and grow a platform product</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/platform-product/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A platform product/business, also referred to as a &amp;lsquo;plugin&amp;rsquo; or &amp;rsquo;embedded software,&amp;rsquo; is a product that lives inside a larger platform. Slack apps, Shopify apps, Monday apps etc. are all examples of such products.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-build-inside-another-platform&#34;&gt;Why build inside another platform?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve built two profitable platform products so far (Canopact, Data Importer). I&amp;rsquo;ve also tried to build stand-alone SaaS products, which were an order of magnitude harder to launch and get off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How I prioritise feature requests for Data Importer</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/feature-prioritization/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I get a fair amount of feature requests for Data Importer (currently 10+ per week). Here&amp;rsquo;s how I go about deciding what to work on and when.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a period of just prioritising based on vibes (which I still do sometimes), I thought it was time to look at some of the popular feature request frameworks out there and see which ones would best align with the product I&amp;rsquo;m building.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The best way to get early users in a market you have no experience in</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/articles/early-users/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Conventional start-up wisdom tells us that the best way to get early traction for your product is to launch into a market/industry you already have an understanding of, a network within, an unfair advantage on etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is very good advice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But sometimes (against our better judgement) we don&amp;rsquo;t want to build a product inside a market we already know well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;rsquo;re excited about a problem in a different market, bored to death of the industry you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in for 10+ years, or think there&amp;rsquo;s more growth potential in another area.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
