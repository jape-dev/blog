    The best way to get early users in a market you have no experience in - James Patten
  </title>

  <meta name="description" content="Conventional start-up wisdom tells us that the best way to get early traction for your product is to launch into a market/industry you already have an understanding of, a network within, an unfair advantage on etc.
This is very good advice.
But sometimes (against our better judgement) we don&rsquo;t want to build a product inside a market we already know well.
Maybe you&rsquo;re excited about a problem in a different market, bored to death of the industry you&rsquo;ve been working in for 10&#43; years, or think there&rsquo;s more growth potential in another area." /><meta name="generator" content="Hugo 0.147.0">

      <p>Conventional start-up wisdom tells us that the best way to get early traction for your product is to launch into a market/industry you already have an understanding of, a network within, an unfair advantage on etc.</p>
<p>This is very good advice.</p>
<p>But sometimes (against our better judgement) we don&rsquo;t want to build a product inside a market we already know well.</p>
<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re excited about a problem in a different market, bored to death of the industry you&rsquo;ve been working in for 10+ years, or think there&rsquo;s more growth potential in another area.</p>
<p>Whilst it&rsquo;s harder to land and expand in an unfamiliar market, it&rsquo;s certainly still possible and it shouldn&rsquo;t discourage you from trying.</p>
<h2 id="find-the-online-communities-where-your-ideal-customer-profile-hangs-out">Find the online communities where your ideal customer profile hangs out</h2>
<p>Slack groups, LinkedIn groups, Facebook groups, community forums, Reddit etc. Ideally focus on one community to start with — there&rsquo;s usually always one that is the biggest and most active.</p>
<p>A few things to keep in mind when looking for the community:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s sufficiently active — there are so many graveyard communities that have thousands of members but very little activity.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s well moderated and the moderators don&rsquo;t allow self-promotion — this is counterintuitive given we want to use this community for self-promotion.</li>
</ol>
<p>It may be that your ideal customer profile tends to hang out more at in-person events. In all honesty, I think this approach is harder to execute in that situation. Online communities give you far more leverage early on.</p>
<h2 id="create-your-profile-in-the-community">Create your profile in the community</h2>
<p>Most online communities should give you some kind of bio space for your profile. This is going to be your micro landing page within that community.</p>
<p>All that really matters is that it contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear, non-spammy description of who you are (position yourself as someone who solves a particular type of problem).</li>
<li>A link to your product.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="answer-questions-create-posts-and-add-value">Answer questions, create posts, and add value</h2>
<p>Even if it&rsquo;s a question you don&rsquo;t immediately know the answer to, research the solution, put together a thoughtful response, and share it.</p>
<p>Consistency is key. Show up every day or every few days. Become a known name.</p>
<p>Over time, people will start to notice the quality of your contributions. They&rsquo;ll click your profile out of curiosity. That&rsquo;s where your bio (and your link) does its job.</p>
<h2 id="never-directly-promote-your-product">Never directly promote your product</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s some nuance to this, and it definitely depends on the culture of the community, but as a general rule: don&rsquo;t post links to your product publicly or make overt sales pitches.</p>
<p>Even if someone asks a question that your product directly solves, resist the urge to reply with &ldquo;hey, I built X, check it out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead, answer the question thoughtfully, educate them, and trust that the curious ones will find your profile link themselves.</p>
<p>If a conversation moves to direct messaging and it feels natural, then — and only then — you can share your product more explicitly.</p>
<p>The key is to preserve trust. If you come across as self-serving, you&rsquo;ll burn your reputation fast and lose the channel completely.</p>
<h2 id="learn-as-you-gather-leads">Learn as you gather leads</h2>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that it does more than just get you early users — it gives you incredibly high-quality feedback.</p>
<p>Because you&rsquo;re embedded in the community and interacting authentically, you&rsquo;ll naturally start to see:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which problems are the most painful</li>
<li>How your target customers talk about those problems</li>
<li>What language they use (helpful for marketing later)</li>
<li>Gaps in your current product</li>
<li>Opportunities for adjacent features or services</li>
</ul>
<p>In many ways, the leads you gather are almost a byproduct. You&rsquo;re building relationships, learning the market from the inside out, and gradually carving out a reputation.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s slower than buying ads. It&rsquo;s more manual than spamming cold emails. But it&rsquo;s real.</p>
<p>And in a market you have no experience in, trust and reputation are your most powerful levers.</p>
