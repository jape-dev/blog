      <p>I get a fair amount of feature requests for Data Importer (currently 10+ per week). Here&rsquo;s how I go about deciding what to work on and when.</p>
<p>After a period of just prioritising based on vibes (which I still do sometimes), I thought it was time to look at some of the popular feature request frameworks out there and see which ones would best align with the product I&rsquo;m building.</p>
<p>There were a few criteria that I was looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not too overkill:</strong> As a part-time solo bootstrapped product, I don&rsquo;t want to spend more time prioritising the product than actually shipping it.</li>
<li><strong>Fast to apply:</strong> I need a system where I can quickly run a feature request through some mental checks and have a good sense of priority without needing to write a 10-page strategy document.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible to gut feel:</strong> I wanted something that supports a structured approach but also allows space for instinct and qualitative judgement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, I settled on the <strong>value vs effort matrix</strong>. It aligned well with the above criteria for Data Importer and, honestly, I think most feature prioritisation frameworks are just a variation on this core concept anyway.</p>
<h2 id="quantifying-effort">Quantifying Effort</h2>
<p>Fairly straightforward. Having worked on the product for some time, I have a good sense of estimating development time for a feature. Obviously there will always be a degree of error in this, but in general I find that it converges toward reasonable accuracy (i.e. underestimated features are offset by underestimated features)</p>
<h2 id="quantifying-value">Quantifying Value</h2>
<p>Definitely <strong>not</strong> straightforward. Quantifying value is much harder than quantifying effort. Trying to assign a numeric score to value often feels forced — but having <em>some</em> structure helps.</p>
<p>For Data Importer, I usually look at two main lenses:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Closeness to revenue:</strong> How directly will this feature increase acquisition, conversion, or retention? If a feature can meaningfully reduce churn or close a sale that&rsquo;s already in the pipeline, it gets a boost in priority.</li>
<li><strong>Relevance to the user base:</strong> What percentage of my existing (or ideal) customers would benefit from this? Something that helps 80% of users is usually higher priority than something that helps 5%, unless the 5% are a particularly valuable segment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, there are flaws in this. Some features may have strategic or long-term value that isn&rsquo;t obvious right now. Plus, technical debt, infrastructure improvements, and product polish don&rsquo;t always show up clearly in a &ldquo;value score,&rdquo; but neglecting them can be fatal over time.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, prioritisation is an imperfect science. The goal isn&rsquo;t to be correct every time — it&rsquo;s to be approximately right most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="prioritise-based-on-vibes">Prioritise Based on Vibes</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;d love to say I use the above framework every time I plan out what I&rsquo;m going to work on each month, week, or day. The truth is, I don&rsquo;t — and often for good reason.</p>
<p>Sometimes, motivation is a finite resource. There are days when the idea of tackling a big, high-effort, high-value feature feels like pulling teeth. On those days, it&rsquo;s better to knock out a few smaller wins to regain momentum and keep the muscle of shipping alive.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d rather ship something small than ship nothing at all. Analysis paralysis is one of the biggest hurdles to overcome as a solo builder.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a reason why product management is often described as both an art and a science.</p>
