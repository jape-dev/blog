    How to start and grow a platform product - James Patten

      <p>A platform product/business, also referred to as a &lsquo;plugin&rsquo; or &rsquo;embedded software,&rsquo; is a product that lives inside a larger platform. Slack apps, Shopify apps, Monday apps etc. are all examples of such products.</p>
<h2 id="why-build-inside-another-platform">Why build inside another platform?</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built two profitable platform products so far (Canopact, Data Importer). I&rsquo;ve also tried to build stand-alone SaaS products, which were an order of magnitude harder to launch and get off the ground.</p>
<p>In particular, there are two leg ups that building inside another platform gives you:</p>
<ol>
<li>An instant acquisition channel for users by listing into the platform&rsquo;s app marketplace.</li>
<li>Familiarity with the product – users already understand the parent platform, which makes it easier for the onboarding flow to feel natural and low-friction.</li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the platform, there could also be advantages such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A standardised installation/onboarding flow</li>
<li>Managed billing</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a growing argument that with the arrival of LLM-assisted coding tools, the barriers to launching stand-alone products are no longer as steep. I&rsquo;d say that holds true for building an MVP, but not for getting an instant and reliable acquisition channel which is the single biggest advantage of a platform business.</p>
<h2 id="finding-ideas">Finding ideas</h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s pretty much an infinite number of ways to discover startup ideas, but there are two main proven strategies I&rsquo;ve seen work time and time again for platform businesses is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Look at forums/groups for features or pain points that customers are requesting or complaining about. Build a product around them.</li>
<li>Take an existing feature or platform product that&rsquo;s successful on one marketplace, and build it in a different marketplace.</li>
</ol>
<p>These work fantastically well for product discovery. With (1), you have some upfront validation that there is a group of users who share the same problem. With (2), you have validation that this is a problem people are already paying to solve.</p>
<p>If you have both of these, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a pretty surefire sign that there&rsquo;s an opportunity to build a product that will at the very least get some initial paying customers.</p>
<h2 id="picking-a-platform">Picking a platform</h2>
<p>Not all platforms are equal. The best platforms for plugin businesses typically have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A mature and well-trafficked app marketplace</li>
<li>A friendly developer experience (clear docs, stable APIs, fair rate limits)</li>
<li>An active user base that is open to third-party tools</li>
<li>A monetisation model that allows you to charge users directly or via the platform</li>
</ul>
<p>Some platforms allow you to create plugins, but don&rsquo;t have a dedicated place for users to <em>discover</em> them. This can severely limit your growth, even if the product is good.</p>
<p>Consider how well-promoted the marketplace is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the platform highlight apps in onboarding flows or in-app suggestions?</li>
<li>Are there &ldquo;staff picks&rdquo; or rankings that can surface quality products?</li>
</ul>
<p>Also consider <strong>platform hostility</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do they actively discourage (or ban) promotion of marketplace apps in their community forums?</li>
<li>Are APIs or SDKs unstable or frequently changed without notice?</li>
<li>Is there a history of popular apps being copied or delisted?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-your-first-users">Getting your first users</h2>
<p>Your first acquisition channel will ideally be organic leads coming in through the app marketplace.</p>
<p>Your second acquisition channel should be the main/biggest community forum of the marketplace.</p>
<p>Not all platforms have a community forum, but if they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Post in the forums when you launch</li>
<li>Engage with users, answer questions, and build trust</li>
<li>Share demos or walkthroughs</li>
</ul>
<p>These early interactions can lead to your first batch of real users.</p>
<h2 id="getting-your-first-paid-users">Getting your first paid users</h2>
<p>Start simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offer a free trial or freemium plan to get people in the door</li>
<li>Use pricing tiers that scale with usage or number of seats</li>
<li>Consider pricing psychology: plugins often need to feel &ldquo;cheap relative to the platform,&rdquo; but you can usually find room to charge if you focus on ROI</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="growing">Growing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Optimise your marketplace listing: title, keywords, screenshots, reviews</li>
<li>Move beyond community forums for marketing:
<ul>
<li>Create YouTube videos or tutorials</li>
<li>Invest in SEO and content marketing</li>
<li>Reach out to relevant newsletters or communities</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Build integrations or enhancements based on user feedback to increase stickiness</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-headwinds-your-platform-business-will-face">The headwinds your platform business will face</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Platform Risk</strong>: probably the biggest single issue. You are beholden to the platform you&rsquo;re building in. At any point, they could de-list your app, hike API pricing, or just build your functionality natively.</li>
<li><strong>Pricing Constraints</strong>: very much dependent on your product and not always true (especially for enterprise), but usually customers don&rsquo;t want to pay more for a plugin than they do for the overall platform, which can limit your pricing.</li>
<li><strong>UI/UX Limitations</strong>: you&rsquo;ll undoubtedly come up against feature requests that you just can&rsquo;t fulfil due to API or UI constraints. For example, with Data Importer, I&rsquo;m bound to the rate limits of monday.com, which makes certain features impractical.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="knowing-when-youve-hit-a-ceiling">Knowing when you&rsquo;ve hit a ceiling</h2>
<p>All SaaS products have a natural ceiling. When your churn offsets your new customer acquisition, and growth stalls consistently, that&rsquo;s a strong signal.</p>
<p>So what next?</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there another platform that you could launch the same product in?</li>
<li>Can you expand outside of the platform, into a stand-alone version?</li>
<li>Can you launch a new product in the same platform, solving a different pain point?</li>
</ul>
